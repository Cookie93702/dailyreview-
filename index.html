            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I was born in August 15 in 2000</p>
                <p>In Fresno California</p>
                <p>I as myself enjoy reading pretty much like nonfiction books or maybe fiction, also news articles, research reports  or just taking walks or sometimes I just play piano after a stressful day.</p>
                <p>There is 4 brothers (including me) and one sister. I’m the youngest so I’m basically the baby of the family. It’s cute for some part because when we go to our family reunions or party’s my mom always praises that I’m the baby and this and that about the baby. Speaking of vacations I love traveling and exploring places and I wish I could travel around and explore the different cultures. What I mostly crave is like going to Germany, another thing is that I’m a nature enthusiast and I love nature what I would visit someday is like a place like in Alaska or maybe Sweden I just love seeing the nature and the wonders of the earth it is sure breathtaking and it just makes me so happy and grateful that there such a beautiful thing around us .</p>
